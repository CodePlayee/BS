    (BoundingBox2D, Circle2D, CubicBezier2D, Ellipse2D, 
    Line2D, Polygon2D, QuadraticBezier2D, Rectangle2D)

8. 给定线的坐标，根据线距离起点的长度绘制依比例宽度的线（实质上是多边形）
A class for drawing lines of different width (like rivers) on a map，
useful when you want to show how rivers 'flow' on the map.

10. 点是否在多边形内的检测
    https://github.com/rowanwins/point-in-polygon-hao

11. polygon or polyline坐标整理(去除冗余、共线点等)
Clean polygon or polyline coordinates: remove duplicates, degenerate, collinear or bad items, trim.
    https://github.com/dy/polyline-clean

12. 使用凸多边形划分平面图结构
Fast and accurate tessellation of planar graphs with convex polygons
